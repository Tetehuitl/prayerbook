\subsubsection{Psalm 142}\label{psalm-142}

O Lord, hear my prayer, give ear unto my supplication in Thy truth; 
hearken unto me in Thy righteousness. And enter not into judgment with Thy servant, for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.
~~For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; 
he hath humbled my life down to the earth.
~~He hath sat me in darkness as those that have been long dead, and my spirit within me is become despondent; 
within me my heart is troubled.
~~I remembered days of old, I meditated on all Thy works, I pondered on the creations of Thy hands. 
I stretched forth my hands unto Thee; my soul thirsteth after Thee like a waterless land.
~~Quickly hear me, O Lord; 
my spirit hath fainted away.
~~Turn not Thy face away from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
~~Cause me to hear Thy mercy in the morning; 
for in Thee have I put my hope.
~~Cause me to know, O Lord, the way wherein I should walk; 
for unto Thee have I lifted up my soul.
~~Rescue me from mine enemies, O Lord; 
unto Thee have I fled for refuge. 
Teach me to do Thy will, for Thou art my God.
~~Thy good Spirit shall lead me in the land of uprightness; 
for Thy name's sake, O Lord, shalt Thou quicken me.
~~In Thy righteousness shalt Thou bring my soul out of affliction, and in Thy mercy shalt Thou utterly destroy mine enemies.
~~And Thou shalt cut off all them that afflict my soul, for I am Thy servant.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages.~Amen.

Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.~~Glory to Thee, O God.

\emph{\textbf{This Troparion,}
~\textbf{4th~Tone:}}

To the Theotokos let us run now most earnestly, we sinners all and wretched ones, and fall down in repentance calling from the depths of our souls:
~~O Lady, come unto our aid, have compassion upon us; 
hasten thou for we are lost in a throng of transgressions.
~~Turn not thy servants away with empty hands, for thee alone do we have as our only hope.
~~\emph{Twice.}

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages.~Amen.

Never, O Theotokos, will we cease to speak of thy powers, unworthy as we are.
~~For if thou didst not intercede in prayer, who would have delivered us from so many dangers?~~Who would have kept us free until now?
~~Let us never forsake thee, O Lady, for thou dost ever save thy servants from all perils.

\textbf{Psalm 50}

Have mercy on me, O God, according to Thy great mercy; and according to the multitude of Thy compassions blot out my transgression. 
Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
~For I know mine iniquity, and my sin is ever before me.
~Against Thee only have I sinned and done this evil before Thee, that Thou mightest be justified
in Thy words, and prevail when Thou art judged. 
For behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother bear me. 
For behold, Thou hast loved truth; the hidden and secret things of Thy wisdom hast Thou made manifest unto me. 
Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be made clean; 
Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow. 
Thou shalt make me to hear joy and gladness; 
the bones that be humbled, they shall rejoice. 
Turn Thy face away from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. 
Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. 
Cast me not away from Thy presence, and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me. 
Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and with Thy governing Spirit establish me. 
I shall teach transgressors Thy ways, and the ungodly shall turn back unto Thee. 
Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation; 
my tongue shall rejoice in Thy righteousness. 
O Lord, Thou shalt open my lips, and my mouth shall declare Thy praise. 
For if Thou hadst desired sacrifice, I had given it; 
with whole-burnt offerings Thou shalt not be pleased. 
A sacrifice unto God is a broken spirit; 
a heart that is broken and humbled God will not despise. 
Do~good, O Lord, in Thy good pleasure unto Zion, and let the walls of Jerusalem be builded. 
Then shalt Thou be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, with oblation and whole-burnt offerings. 
Then shall they offer bullocks upon Thine altar.

\textbf{\emph{Senior~Reader:}}
~~O Lord, Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on us.

\textbf{\emph{Choir:}}
~~Amen.

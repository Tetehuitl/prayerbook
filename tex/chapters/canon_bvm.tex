\chapter{Canon to the Most Holy Theotokos}

\textbf{Canon, tone 8:}

\textbf{Song 1.}

\textbf{Eirmos:} 
When Israel passed through the water as dry land, and had escaped the malice of the Egyptians, they cried: 
Let us sing to our Redeemer and our God.

\emph{Most Holy Theotokos, save us.}

Distressed by many temptations, I fly for refuge to thee, seeking salvation. 
O Mother of the Word, and Virgin, bring me safely through dangers and difficulties.

\emph{Most Holy Theotokos, save us.}

Outbursts of passion trouble me and fill my soul with great despondency.
Calm it, O Maiden, by the peace of thy Son and God, O all-innocent one.

\emph{Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:}

I implore thee who gavest birth to our Saviour and God, O Virgin, to deliver me from perils. 
For to thee I now run, lifting up my mind and soul.

\emph{Now and ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.}

Sick in body and soul, make me worthy of the divine visitation, and of thy care, O only Mother of God, for thou art good and the bearer of the Good One.

\textbf{Song 3.}

\textbf{Eirmos:} O Lord, Creator of the vault of Heaven and Builder of the Church, strengthen me in Thy love, O Summit of desire, O Support of the faithful, O only Lover of men.

\emph{Most Holy Theotokos, save us.}

I have chosen thee to be the protection and intercession of my life, O Virgin, Mother of God. Guide me to thy haven, O cause of all blessings, O support of the faithful, O only praise of all.

\emph{Most Holy Theotokos, save us.}

I pray thee, O Virgin, to dispel the tumult of my soul and the storm of my grief; 
for thou, O Bride of God, didst bear Christ, the Prince of Peace, O only immaculate one.

\emph{Most Holy Theotokos, save us.}

O thou who didst bear the Benefactor and Author of good things, pour on all the riches of well-doing and good conduct; 
all is possible to thee, for thou gavest birth to Christ, mighty in power, O divinely blessed one.

\emph{Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:}

Keep thy servants from conflicts, O Mother of God, for we all fly for refuge to thee after God, as an impregnable wall and protection.

\emph{Now and ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.}

I am tortured by grievous sicknesses and morbid passions: O Virgin, help me! 
For I know thee to be the inexhaustible, unfailing treasury of healings, O all-blameless one.

Lord, have mercy 
\emph{(thrice).}

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

O Mother of God, O Sovereign Lady, forestall and deliver us from dangers, O only speedy intercessor.

\textbf{Song 4.}

\textbf{Eirmos:} I have heard, O Lord, the mystery of Thy plan. 
I contemplate Thy works and glorify Thy divine nature.

\emph{Most Holy Theotokos, save us.}

O thou who didst bear the Lord Jesus, still the storm of my sins, and the turmoil of my passions, O Bride of God.

\emph{Most Holy Theotokos, save us.}

I call upon the abyss of thy compassion---grant it me, for thou didst bear the kind-hearted One and Saviour of all who sing to thee.

\emph{Most Holy Theotokos, save us.}

Enjoying thy gifts, O all-pure one, we sing a song of thanksgiving to thee, knowing thee to be the Mother of God.

\emph{Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:}

As I lie on the bed of my pain and sickness, help me, for thou art a lover of goodness and the only Ever-Virgin Mother of God.

\emph{Most Holy Theotokos, save us.}

Deliver us from conflicts, O pure Mother of God, who didst bear our Eternal Redemption and the Peace that passes all understanding.

Heal, O pure one, the disease of my passions, when thou hast made me worthy of thy visitation, and grant me health by thine intercession.

\textbf{Song 6.}

\textbf{Eirmos:} 
I will pour out my prayer to the Lord, and to Him I will confess my grief; 
for my soul is full of evil and my life has drawn near to hell, and like Jonah I will pray: 
Raise me up from corruption, O God.

\emph{Most Holy Theotokos, save us.}

O Virgin, implore thy Son and Lord Who from death and corruption has saved my nature, captured by corruption and death, by giving Himself to death, to deliver me from my enemies' evil actions.

\emph{Most Holy Theotokos, save us.}

I know thee as the intercessor and safest guardian of my life, O Virgin, who puttest a stop to the swarm of temptations and drivest off the insolent onsets of devils; 
and I pray continually: Deliver me from the corruption of my passions.

\emph{Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:}

We have thee as a wall of refuge and the perfect salvation of our souls and release from our afflictions, O Maiden, and we ever rejoice in thy light. 
O Sovereign Lady keep us safe now from passions and conflicts.

\emph{Now and ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.}

Now I lie on a bed of infirmities, and there is no healing for my flesh; 
but I pray to thee, O gracious Lady, who didst bear God and the Saviour of the world and the Healer of sicknesses: Raise me up from the corruption of disease.

Lord, have mercy 
\emph{(thrice).}

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

\textbf{Kontakion, tone 6:}

O unfailing intercessor of Christians, O constant mediatrix before the Creator, despise not the cry of prayer of us sinners; 
but, of thy goodness, come speedily to the help of us who in faith call upon thee.
Hasten to offer swift intercession and prayer (for us), O Mother of God, who ever intercedes for those who honour thee.

\textbf{Another kontakion, tone 6:}

We have no other help, we have no other hope, but thee, O pure Mother of God--- help us! 
In thee we hope, and of thee we boast, for we are thy slaves. 
Let us not be put to shame.

\textbf{Song 7.}

\textbf{Eirmos:} 
Having arrived in Babylon from, Judea, the Children of old by their faith in the Trinity trod down the flame of the furnace, singing: 
O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou.

Wishing to accomplish our salvation, Thou didst dwell in the womb of the Virgin, O Saviour, and didst reveal her to the world as the mediatrix: 
O God of our fathers, blessed art Thou.

\emph{Most Holy Theotokos, save us.}

O pure mother who didst bear the Lover of Mercy, implore Him to deliver from sins and from defilements of the soul those who with faith cry:
